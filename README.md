# Desocialize Media

![Smiley face with silencing X over mouth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/desocialize-media/main/icons/mute-128.png)

A browser extension for Chrome and Firefox to de-socialize your social media by removing comments from your favourite platforms.

You can still see comments if you click a content item directly, such as opening a photograph on Instagram.

## Firefox

## Chrome

## Why?

My inner stoic needed a little help to deal with, shall we say, the inexplicable conduct of internet randos spewing insanity and puerile vitriol, polluting the comments of many government/news posts.

## Which platforms are supported?

Currently only Instagram and Facebook are supported.

## Will it work on mobile?

Well, it will work in your _mobile browser_ but I imagine that's not what you meant.

It will not work on native mobile apps as this is a _browser extension_.
