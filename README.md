# Desocialize Media

A browser extension for Chrome and Firefox to de-socialize your social media by removing comments from your favourite platforms.

You can still see comments if you click a content item directly, such as opening a photograph on Instagram.

## Why?

My inner stoic needed a little help to deal with, shall we say, the inexplicable conduct of internet randos.

## Which platforms are supported?

Currently only Instagram and Facebook are supported. No, just the browser.

## Will it work on mobile?

Well, it will work in your _mobile browser_ but I imagine that's not what you meant.
